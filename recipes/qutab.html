        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Qutab is a dish from Western Asia, made from thinly rolled dough that is filled and fried. There are different variations across Asia and Africa. Similar to dishes known as chebureki, gözleme, stuffed roti, parantha and msemen maamer.  </p>
        <p>The dough is rolled into a thin circular layer and the middle of each circle filled with stuffing before finally being folded into a crescent shape. The resulting patties are griddled on both sides and served by pouring over butter on top. Qutab is usually served with yoghurt with green coriander, fennel and sumac.</p>
