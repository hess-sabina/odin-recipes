        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Qutab is a dish from Western Asia, made from thinly rolled dough that is filled and fried. There are different variations across Asia and Africa. Similar to dishes known as chebureki, g√∂zleme, stuffed roti, parantha and msemen maamer.  </p>
        <p>The dough is rolled into a thin circular layer and the middle of each circle filled with stuffing before finally being folded into a crescent shape. The resulting patties are griddled on both sides and served by pouring over butter on top. Qutab is usually served with yoghurt with green coriander, fennel and sumac.</p>
