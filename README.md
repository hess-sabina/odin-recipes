# odin-recipes
HTML foundations project for TOP

With this project I will be demonstrating that I can do the following tasks:

1) Create a repository using Git/GitHub
2) work on the repository, change and save files.
3) Use Shell to navigate 
4) use VsCode to create the page
5) Create a simple website with the use of html

Going further in the foundations, CSS and JS will be added.
